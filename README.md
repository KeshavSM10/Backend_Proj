DevOps-Backed Game Score Management System
Overview
This project started as a learning exercise but evolved into a robust Java Spring Boot backend system with industry-level DevOps integration. The system is Dockerized, making it a great step toward understanding and implementing DevOps best practices in real-world applications.

It is not a gaming platform but rather a game score management system that serves as a score guide and game score pallet for players. Currently, it supports Lawn Tennis but is designed for scalability, allowing easy extension to 10+ games in the future.

Key Features
âœ… MySQL Database â€“ Stores and retrieves player and game data efficiently.
âœ… Redis Caching â€“ Supports 100K+ concurrent games with 99.99% independence and isolation.
âœ… LLM Integration â€“ Integrated with GPT-2 (via Hugging Face API) for basic AI interactions.
âœ… REST API â€“ Follows proper RESTful principles for smooth backend interactions.
âœ… Dockerization â€“ Ensures easy deployment and scalability.
