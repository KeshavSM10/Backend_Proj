Hello Everyone, 

This is a Dev-Ops backend system building in process. This was meant to be part of learning but turned out to be a strong Cs project for Java, Springboot backend Developement. With Dockerized systemization, this is a step way to learn Dev-Ops and implement in real life with industry majors and standards. This system servesd as score guide and game score pallet for players. Not a gaming platform but more a game guide. Currently has only one Game [Lawn tennis] but can be extended to 10+ games. Also has MySQl connection to store and retrieve players data as well as games data. has Redis in use to maintain data of 100k+ concurrent games with 99.99% independence and isolation. Integrated with basic LLM i.e. gpt2 using it's API taken from hugging face. So this is a scalable, reliable, semi-Industry ready project.
This project made my undrstanding of Backend developement, REST principles and software engineering strong.
